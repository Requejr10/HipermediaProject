Project Analisis:
1.User profile
 The end users of my website are people who want to find computer science students who want to learn and solve new problems. This person will be looking for young people with a strong desire to learn and offer them opportunities for summer work, weekend work or work that can be combined with student studies.

Such users also look for candidate profiles with technical backgrounds, those whose skills still need to be improved. The ideal candidate will be adaptable, willing to learn new technologies and motivated to grow in their role. The end user is most likely a recruiter or company manager looking for a flexible, proactive student who can help with a variety of projects and tasks.


2.Information architecture:
I organize the information in such a way that the user can more easily find what he is looking for. There is a navigation bar at the top of the page that allows users to quickly jump to relevant sections by clicking on it. This design ensures that users can navigate the website smoothly without unnecessary clutter.

The page starts with a short description of me to give users a quick idea of ​​who I am and what I offer. The website then highlighted my programming skills and language skills, showcasing my technical abilities and versatility. These sections are designed to provide the user with a clear picture of my qualifications in a concise, easy-to-read format.

At the bottom of the page, I have included a complete resume detailing my professional experience and educational background. , qualifications and contact information. I decided to put the entire summary on the page itself to save users time downloading or looking elsewhere. This makes it more convenient and easier for users to view all information in one place.

This content organization makes it possibleMy goal is to ensure that users can quickly navigate the site, find relevant information about my qualifications, and make informed decisions without distractions or unnecessary clicks. The design emphasizes simplicity, ease of use and excellent user experience.

3.Visual design:
I chose a dark color scheme with blue accents for contrast. I chose light blue because it is associated with technology and innovation. Darker tones give the site a sleek and professional look, while light blue adds a pop of color that stands out without being overwhelming.

To enhance the overall look, I added subtle animations that play against this contrast, making the site more visually appealing while maintaining a clean and cohesive design. For full page links, I made sure that when the user hovers over them, the color changes and the link "lights up" with a shadow effect. This small detail helps users notice them when they hover over them.

I also added animation to the main photo and description to give the page some movement and draw attention to my main description. Animations are smooth and non-distracting, allowing users to focus on the content without feeling overwhelmed.

Overall, the site uses these contrasts to make information readable and visually pleasing without causing eye strain.My goal was to create a design that was not only visually appealing but also provided a simple and enjoyable user experience.
